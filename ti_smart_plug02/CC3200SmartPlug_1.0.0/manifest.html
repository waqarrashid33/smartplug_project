A notation often used in the manifests is [as installed]/directory/*. Note that the asterisk implies that all

Additional Definitions.<BR><BR>  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<BR>General Public License.<BR><BR>  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<BR>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<BR><BR>  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<BR>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<BR>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<BR>of using an interface provided by the Library.<BR><BR>  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<BR>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<BR>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<BR>Version".<BR><BR>  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<BR>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<BR>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<BR>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<BR><BR>  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<BR>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<BR>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<BR>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<BR><BR>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<BR>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<BR><BR>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<BR><BR>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<BR>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<BR>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<BR>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<BR>version:<BR><BR>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<BR>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<BR>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<BR>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<BR><BR>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<BR>   this License applicable to that copy.<BR><BR>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<BR><BR>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<BR>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<BR>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<BR>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<BR>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<BR>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<BR>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>  4. Combined Works.<BR><BR>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<BR>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<BR>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<BR>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<BR>the following:<BR><BR>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<BR>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<BR>   covered by this License.<BR><BR>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<BR>   document.<BR><BR>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<BR>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<BR>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<BR>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<BR><BR>   d) Do one of the following:<BR><BR>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<BR>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<BR>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<BR>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<BR>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<BR>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<BR>       Corresponding Source.<BR><BR>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<BR>       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<BR>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<BR>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<BR>       Version.<BR><BR>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<BR>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<BR>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<BR>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<BR>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<BR>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<BR>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<BR>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<BR>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<BR>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<BR>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<BR><BR>  5. Combined Libraries.<BR><BR>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<BR>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<BR>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<BR>choice, if you do both of the following:<BR><BR>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<BR>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<BR>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<BR><BR>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<BR>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<BR>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR><BR>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<BR><BR>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<BR>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<BR>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<BR>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<BR>of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<BR>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<BR>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<BR>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<BR>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<BR>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<BR>apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<BR>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<BR>Library.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Apache License<BR><BR>Version 2.0, January 2004<BR><BR>http://www.apache.org/licenses/<BR><BR>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<BR><BR>1.
